# Project 8
I created a site that makes a fetch api request to a Random User Generator API. I then dynamically displayed the employee results on to the page.

## Features Include
1. Function to add employee info to page
2. fetch API call to https://randomuser.me/api/
3. Dynamically input html to populate page with employee info.
4. Added event listener to display modal on selected employee information.
